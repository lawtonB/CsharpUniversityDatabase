# CsharpUniversityDatabase

This app demonstrates understanding of join tables and many to many relationships in the context of a hypothetical university. It allows users to enter a student into a database with their name and date of enrollment as well as entering courses with course name and a course number and then assigns students to courses following a many to many relationship. It was built by lawton browning for the epicodus CSharp course on march 1st 2016. contact me at lawton.a.browning@gmail.com
